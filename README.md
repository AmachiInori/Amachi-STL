# Amachi-STL Readme

## What is this

This is a simple version of the STL standard library, which is in the development stage. Depending on the characteristics of C++ 11, it can support compilers above C++ 17.
I have done some optimization in coding style and readability, but in order to ensure brevity, only the English description of user-visible methods and functions is indicated in the comment, and other descriptions or Chinese descriptions are referred to the documents.
